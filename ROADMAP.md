## Bugs
- [x] Mercury offset shouldn't be fixed (it's too close to the sun)
- [] Rotatioin axis are not centered - from one pole it could be more extended than from the other
- [] Even tho rings are right at the center it seams to be off-center (shadows?)
- [] At some point labels are misaligned

## Features
- [x] Add Saturn's rings
- [ ] Realtime API uses planet on focus and tell a story about peculiarities of the planet
- [x] Add unusual facts overlay for each planet
- [ ] In voice mode, how about we would add streaming text of summary of the response
