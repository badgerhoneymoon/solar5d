## Bugs
- [x] Mercury offset shouldn't be fixed (it's too close to the sun)

- [] Even tho rings are right at the center it seams to be off-center (shadows?)
- [] At some point labels are misaligned
- [] If I turn on voice and then turn off quickly it will not shut it down

- [] Earth - add day / night textures to reflect the sun position
- [] Imitate Starship intercepting Mars orbit
